Depression Detection on Textual Data Using various Large Language models(LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)

This project involves the detection of depression in textual data, utilizing various models. By employing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT), we optimize the performance and efficiency of the models. The dataset used is a collection of >=7,500 real-life Reddit posts or a dataset containing suicidal and non-suicidal text providing a rich and diverse set of textual data for training and evaluation.
